# Project Goals of Opteryx

## Introduction

Opteryx is a SQL Query Engine written in Python, designed to be robust, efficient, and adaptable. It serves as a crucial component in data processing and analysis, leveraging the power of sqlparser-rs for SQL to AST parsing and PyArrow for internal data format management. This document outlines the core goals of the Opteryx project.

## Core Goals

### 1. **Speed and Efficiency**

- **Implementation:** Utilize efficient algorithms and data structures, along with performance-driven coding practices. When making coding decisions, speed is the priority, while maintaining code readability through good naming and commenting.

### 2. **Correctness and Reliability**

- **Data Integrity:** Maintain the integrity and accuracy of data throughout the query processing lifecycle.

### 3. **Maintainability**

- **Codebase:** Write clear, well-documented, and modular code that aligns with PEP8 guidelines, facilitating ease of maintenance and collaboration.

### 4. **Transparency, Extensibility, and Adaptability**

- **Implementation:** Aims for transparency, maintainability, and extensibility, allowing for future growth and adaptation to new requirements or technologies.

### 5. **Community and Collaboration**

- **Open Source Contribution:** Foster an open-source community that encourages contributions, feedback, and collaborative development.
- **Documentation and Support:** Provide comprehensive documentation and support to assist contributors in understanding and working with Opteryx effectively.

### 6. **Integration and Compatibility**

- **Consumption:** Ensure compatibility with various data sources and formats.
- **Interfaces:** Align to standard and established interfaces for accessing the features.
- **Expandability:** Design with a forward-thinking approach to support future integrations and expansions in the data processing landscape.

## Conclusion

Opteryx aims to balance the need for speed with correctness, maintainability, and adaptability. By adhering to these goals, we strive to create a tool that is not only powerful and efficient but also reliable and easy to use and contribute to.

We welcome contributions that help push Opteryx towards these goals.
