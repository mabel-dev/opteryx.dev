# Community Etiquette

### Be nice to everyone
Assume everyone has good intentions.

### Check off your resolved questions
If you have received a useful reply to your question, please drop a âœ… reaction or a reply for affirmation.

### Try not to repost question
If you have asked a question and have not got a response in 24hrs, please review your question for clarity and revise it.

### Post in public  
Please don't direct message any individual member of Mabel community without their explicit permission, independent of reason. Your question might be helpful for other community members.

### Don't spam tags  
Mabel and Opteryx are supported by volunteers, avoid tagging members unless it is urgent.

### Use threads for discussion  
To keep the main channel area clear, we request to use threads to keep an ongoing conversation organized.
