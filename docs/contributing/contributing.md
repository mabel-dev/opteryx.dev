# Contributor Guide

**Welcome to the Opteryx Contributor Guide.**

In this section you will find information to help you to bring your unique skills and experience and join us in building Opteryx.

Opteryx is primarily written in Python, but you don't need to be a Python developer to contribute. All contributions, [bug reports](https://github.com/mabel-dev/opteryx/issues/new/choose), documentation improvements, and [ideas](https://github.com/mabel-dev/opteryx/discussions) are welcome.

## Our Tools

### GitHub

We use [GitHub](https://github.com/mabel-dev/opteryx) to host the code, track feature requests, perform testing, report bugs and maintain documentation.

All submissions, including submissions by core project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult [GitHub Help](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) for more information on using pull requests. 

Pull requests that add support for, or fix a bug in, a feature in a popular RDBMS, or address deficiency in documentation, will likely be accepted after a brief review. For more substative changes you should start a [discussion](https://github.com/mabel-dev/opteryx/discussions) to coordinate with maintainers.

We have included a number of tests which run automatically when code is submitted to help maintain consistency and quality of the codebase, note that these may not be automatically triggered for new contributors. Pull requests which do not meet the quality criteria will not be reviewed or merged.

Changes should have:  

- Corresponding unit and regression tests  
- A clean execution of the CI tests   
- Updated documentation (code-level, module-level and docs/ folder as appropriate)
- Attributed external sources
