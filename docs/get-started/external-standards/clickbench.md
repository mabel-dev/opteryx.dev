# ClickBench

!!! Note   
    Performance in benchmarks should always be taken with some skepticism, benchmarks tend to be opinionated to specific characteristics and do not represent all factors which should be considered when comparing systems.

[ClickBench](https://benchmark.clickhouse.com/) is a public benchmarking suite developed by [ClickHouse, Inc.](https://clickhouse.com/), designed to evaluate the performance of analytical databases under real-world, single-table summarization workloads. It provides a common ground for comparing query execution speed, efficiency, and scalability across systems.

We use ClickBench to measure how well Opteryx performs on a variety of analytical queries compared to similarly architected and industry-leading databases and query engines. These results help us identify optimization opportunities and validate our engine against established performance expectations.

You can find information on how to reproduce Opteryxâ€™s ClickBench results in the [ClickBench GitHub repository](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickBench/tree/main/opteryx).
