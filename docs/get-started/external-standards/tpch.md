# TPC-H Benchmark

!!! Note   
    Conformance is a work in progress and this information represents the current state in order to provide transparent information about progress and capability.

[TPC](https://www.tpc.org/) publish a set of benchmarks for computer and database systems. [TPC-H](https://www.tpc.org/tpch/default5.asp) is a decision support benchmark which consists of a set of business-oriented queries. This benchmark demonstrates a decision support system that examines large amounts of data, executes highly complex queries, and answers key business questions.

All queries have been modified to refer to the location of the datasets, **modified** in the above table is where the SQL has been written to replace unsupported functionality with supported functionality - this is where the original query either created a view or a temporary table, both of these have been replaced with a CTE definition.

The test suite for this benchmark is in the [Opteryx Benchmarking](https://github.com/mabel-dev/wrenchy-bench) repository.
