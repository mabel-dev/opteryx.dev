# Using Opteryx with Jupyter Notebooks

This guide demonstrates how to use Opteryx, a high-performance SQL query engine, with Jupyter Notebooks to analyze and visualize data interactively. Opteryx is designed to work seamlessly with large datasets and integrates directly with Pythonâ€™s most popular data science libraries.

## Installation

For this guide, we assume you have a working Jupyter environment. For assistance on setting up Jupyter, see [Installing Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install).

> Prebuilt [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mabel-dev/labs/HEAD) notebooks are also available for experimenting with Opteryx without any local setup.

To install Opteryx in your Jupyter environment, run the following command in a notebook cell. This ensures that Opteryx is installed in the same Python environment your notebook is using:

~~~console
# Ensure that Opteryx is installed in the current Jupyter kernel
import sys
!{sys.executable} -m pip install opteryx
~~~

## Getting Started

Here's how to execute a basic SQL query against an internal sample dataset and display the results directly in Jupyter:

~~~python
import opteryx

sql_statement = """
SELECT *
  FROM $planets
"""
results = opteryx.query(sql_statement)

# Display results in a Table
results
~~~

## Integration with Other Libraries

Opteryx supports seamless conversion of query results to formats suitable for further analysis or visualization:

- **Arrow**: Ideal for high-performance data processing.
  `results.arrow()`
- **Pandas**: Best for interactive data manipulation and analysis.
  `results.pandas()`
- **Polars**: Use when working with larger data sets or requiring faster performance.
  `results.polars()`

## Visualizing Data with Matplotlib

After querying data with Opteryx, you can easily visualize it. 

Here's an example of creating a pie chart to show the distribution of missions by company using an internal dataset of missions to space:

~~~python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import opteryx

# Query to count missions per company
sql_statement = """
SELECT COUNT(*) as Missions, Company 
  FROM $missions
 GROUP BY Company
 ORDER BY Missions DESC;
"""
results = opteryx.query(sql_statement)

# Prepare data for the pie chart
missions = list(results["Missions"])
companies = list(results["Company"])
if len(missions) > 9:
    missions = missions[:9] + [sum(missions[9:])]
    companies = companies[:9] + ["Other"]

# Create a pie chart with an 'explode' effect for the largest segment
explode = [0.1 if i == 0 else 0 for i in range(len(missions))]
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.pie(missions, labels=companies, autopct='%1.1f%%', explode=explode, startangle=90, counterclock=False)
ax.set_title('Missions Per Company')
plt.show()
~~~

Happy querying!

## Advanced Examples

### Time Series Analysis

~~~python
import opteryx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Analyze time series data
sql_statement = """
SELECT 
    DATE(timestamp) as date,
    COUNT(*) as events,
    AVG(value) as avg_value
FROM 'logs/*.jsonl'
WHERE timestamp >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY DATE(timestamp)
ORDER BY date
"""
results = opteryx.query(sql_statement).pandas()

# Plot the time series
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(results['date'], results['events'], marker='o')
plt.title('Daily Event Count')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Events')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
~~~

### Working with Multiple Data Sources

~~~python
import opteryx
from opteryx.connectors import SqlConnector
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Register a database connection
engine = create_engine("postgresql+psycopg2://user:pass@host/db")
opteryx.register_store("pg", SqlConnector, remove_prefix=True, engine=engine)

# Join database data with files
sql_statement = """
SELECT 
    u.user_name,
    u.email,
    COUNT(e.event_id) as event_count
FROM pg.users AS u
LEFT JOIN 'events/*.parquet' AS e
ON u.user_id = e.user_id
GROUP BY u.user_name, u.email
ORDER BY event_count DESC
LIMIT 10
"""
results = opteryx.query(sql_statement)
results
~~~

### Interactive Data Exploration

~~~python
import opteryx
import ipywidgets as widgets
from IPython.display import display

# Create interactive filters
date_range = widgets.DateRangeSlider(
    description='Date Range:',
    layout={'width': '500px'}
)

def update_results(change):
    start, end = change['new']
    sql = f"""
    SELECT 
        product_category,
        SUM(amount) as total_sales
    FROM 's3://sales/*.parquet'
    WHERE date BETWEEN '{start}' AND '{end}'
    GROUP BY product_category
    ORDER BY total_sales DESC
    """
    results = opteryx.query(sql)
    display(results)

date_range.observe(update_results, names='value')
display(date_range)
~~~
