# Using Opteryx with Jupyter Notebooks

This guide demonstrates how to use Opteryx, a high-performance SQL query engine, with Jupyter Notebooks to analyze and visualize data interactively. Opteryx is designed to work seamlessly with large datasets and integrates directly with Pythonâ€™s most popular data science libraries.

## Installation

For this guide, we assume you have a working Jupyter environment. For assistance on setting up Jupyter, see [Installing Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install).

> Prebuilt [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mabel-dev/labs/HEAD) notebooks are also available for experimenting with Opteryx without any local setup.

To install Opteryx in your Jupyter environment, run the following command in a notebook cell. This ensures that Opteryx is installed in the same Python environment your notebook is using:

~~~console
# Ensure that Opteryx is installed in the current Jupyter kernel
import sys
!{sys.executable} -m pip install opteryx
~~~

## Getting Started

Here's how to execute a basic SQL query against an internal sample dataset and display the results directly in Jupyter:

~~~python
import opteryx

sql_statement = """
SELECT *
  FROM $planets
"""
results = opteryx.query(sql_statement)

# Display results in a Table
results
~~~

## Integration with Other Libraries

Opteryx supports seamless conversion of query results to formats suitable for further analysis or visualization:

- **Arrow**: Ideal for high-performance data processing.
  `results.arrow()`
- **Pandas**: Best for interactive data manipulation and analysis.
  `results.pandas()`
- **Polars**: Use when working with larger data sets or requiring faster performance.
  `results.polars()`

## Visualizing Data with Matplotlib

After querying data with Opteryx, you can easily visualize it. 

Here's an example of creating a pie chart to show the distribution of missions by company using an internal dataset of missions to space:

~~~python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import opteryx

# Query to count missions per company
sql_statement = """
SELECT COUNT(*) as Missions, Company 
  FROM $missions
 GROUP BY Company
 ORDER BY Missions DESC;
"""
results = opteryx.query(sql_statement)

# Prepare data for the pie chart
missions = list(results["Missions"])
companies = list(results["Company"])
if len(missions) > 9:
    missions = missions[:9] + [sum(missions[9:])]
    companies = companies[:9] + ["Other"]

# Create a pie chart with an 'explode' effect for the largest segment
explode = [0.1 if i == 0 else 0 for i in range(len(missions))]
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.pie(missions, labels=companies, autopct='%1.1f%%', explode=explode, startangle=90, counterclock=False)
ax.set_title('Missions Per Company')
plt.show()
~~~
