there's the classic diagram that shows that on CPU cache is fast, through to spinning rust is slow and it shows scaled timeframes - if it take a second to get data out of registers on the CPU, HDD would take a lifetime. The reference user for Opteryx uses a cloud storage provider for their data - I wish I had spinning rust.

There's two broad approaches to speeding up disk access:

- make disk access faster
- don't do it
